# Rabbit Encryption for MAVLink on ArduPilot

This project implements the Rabbit encryption algorithm and applies it to encrypt MAVLink communication in the ArduPilot system. The project includes a test file "test.encry.cpp" that simulates the encryption process with a sample MAVLink message.

# Project Overview
__. Rabbit Algorithm:__ A fast and secure stream cipher used for encrypting and decrypting MAVLink communication data.  
__. MAVLink Data Simulation:__ "test.encry.cpp" simulates a MAVLink message and demonstrates the application and effect of Rabbit encryption.
# Installation:
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/timmychenhippo/rabbit.git`
